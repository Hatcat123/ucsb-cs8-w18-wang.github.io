  <b> Sanjana Sahayaraj (TA) </b>
  <i> "Hello there. I’m Sanjana (sun-jun-ah) and I’m excited to be TAing this programming course in python. Python is one of the most powerful and developer friendly languages and it's useful to automate and refine tasks in almost every field and I’m sure you will love it once you start using it. About me: I did my bachelors in CS in India and then joined UCSB to do my PhD in CS since the UCSB CS department has very friendly and accomplished professors. My research domain is bioinformatics. When I’m not applying my computer science knowledge to try and improve future healthcare, I enjoy shopping, cooking and dancing. Though I’d love to visit new places and learn about them, my motion sickness doesn’t let me travel much. So I also spend time watching documentaries about other places. This is a great introductory course. You’ve made the right choice by picking it. Feel free to contact me on piazza if you want to talk about python or the current and future possibilities in healthcare research." </i>

  <b> Joel Bagan (Tutor) </b>
  <i> "I'm Joel Bagan (he/him/his), a fourth year Computer Science major, and I was lucky enough to become a tutor for CS8 this quarter. I'm eagerly looking forward to helping students in this introductory course learn about the magical - and oftentimes frustrating - area of Computer Science! Whether you're a computer whiz, or someone who's never touched a keyboard before, I'm here to help you learn the basics of programming. When I took this course, I was still a Math major who just thought computers were neat and wanted to know what went on inside. As I learned more about Computer Science, I realized it was just math, only a lot more fun. I hope that by the end of the quarter, I will have convinced some of you that Computer Science is not only way cooler than math, but an interesting, challenging, and rewarding area to study. From my experiences as a student here, I hope to offer you all advice on projects both in and out of the context of CS8, building up a resume, and developing good programming practices early on in your careers." </i>

  <b> Natasha Lee (Tutor) </b>
  <i> "Hi! I’m Natasha, a fourth year Computer Science major here at UCSB. CS8 was the first time I had ever seen code and programmed a “Hello World” program. I remember feeling like everyone around me was way ahead of me or knew exactly what was going on. But that feeling pushed me work extra hard to catch myself up, allowing me to figure out study habits and tools that worked for my pace of learning. I love being a tutor/mentor because it’s something I wish I had when I first started learning computer science. There are so many resources available online but sometimes you just don’t know where to start. Us tutors can help guide you and point you in the right direction! I’ve been told I look intimidating when I’m not talking, but I promise I’m really nice! Come talk to me about cs8, future courses, watercoloring, and most importantly the best spots to watch the sunset!" </i>

  <b> Arielle Robles (Tutor) </b>
  <i> "Hi everyone :) My name is Arielle Robles (she/her/hers) and I'm a third year CS major. I'm looking forward to meeting you all and helping you throughout CS 8. When I first took CS 8 in my freshman year, I was an actuarial science major still. I ended up loving programming and never looked back after deciding to switch my major to CS! I found myself struggling at first in CS8, never before having written a single program before this course. My TAs really helped me learn how to approach some tough programming problems, how to better debug, and some overall helpful adjustments in learning Linux/Unix! I know how overwhelming and fast-paced CS can seem, but the other tutors and I are extremely eager to help you work through that! I hope I can offer everyone (CS majors and otherwise) helpful insight into the usefulness of the topics you will learn in this course. The fundamental toolset you'll develop here will be built upon for the rest of your time at UCSB, so it's important you feel comfortable asking us tutors for help! You can ask me about python, C++, Java, javascript, HTML/CSS, ChucK, Raspberry Pi & Arduino, and any other general questions, I'll do my best to answer! My interests in CS lie in audio/visual arts. I've taken many classes in the Art and Technology minor program through UCSB's art department such as Digital Programming for the Arts, Art Science Tech, and THEMAS(through the Media Art Technology graduate program). I think information visualization/sonification is super neat, and I'd love to talk about it with anyone who's interested. You can also ask me about the process of switching majors to CS. I have experience interviewing for internships, and I have my first one lined up for Summer 2018 with Asurion in Nashville, TN. I studied physics in Glasgow, Scotland last summer and can answer any questions about EAP as well. Outside of academics, I enjoy film photography, painting, memes, exercising, zero-waste living, and being in the sunshine." </i>

  <b>  Sean Shelton (Tutor) </b>
  <i> "Hey everybody! My name’s Sean (he/him/his), I’m a 4th year Computer Science student, and one of the mentors for CS8 this quarter! I’m excited to be teaching CS8 this quarter because I really want to help people see that computer science can be fun. The general stigma around computer science seems to be that it’s too difficult for people to try, or maybe people HAVE tried it, but had a rough time (e.g. really hard professors / really hard classes) and were turned away. I want to help our students by making sure that they have a good experience by explaining things as clearly as possible, not making everything seem stressful, etc. I started off as a Biology major when I first came to UCSB, and then I switched into computer science, so I know how much of a struggle it can be when you aren’t familiar with programming in the beginning. I’m hoping that through my experiences, I can relate to the students in the class who started off with very little to no programming experience, and help them do their best. When it came to the electives that I took throughout college, they were mainly focused on software development. I have a decent amount of experience with Android programming (thanks to our Human Computer Interaction and Mobile Development classes!), and some experience with web development (since I was able to do an internship during the summer). If you have any questions about the applications of computer science, projects that I’ve done, what it’s like to work in industry, etc., you can come talk to me! As far as interests that I have outside of academics, I mostly like to hang out with friends, play games (mostly PC, but I play like almost all kinds of games), and sometimes skate (not super good, but practice makes perfect hahaha).  If you wanna hear more about it, I’m always open to chat!" </i>

  <b> Delin Sun (Tutor)    </b>
  <i> "Hey guys, This is Delin Sun (he/him/his). I am a second year senior major in computer science (I had many APs that converted into units, so I am just apparently senior; I still have to fulfill many GE requirements). I am currently minoring statistics, but I haven??t decided whether or not to continue minor it. Recalling my first quarter in UCSB, I took CS 8. I only had few AP CS programming experience before taking CS 8. I clearly remember that when I got confused for some course materials, TAs in lab sections helped me out. They were always there whenever I needed help. Consequently, I want to be a tutor for this course in order to give back. I want to be there whenever you need me and provide my best help. So! feel free to ask me any questions during lab sections and open labs. This is my first-time tutoring, so if there is anything you think I can do better, feel free to point that out! I received an internship offer from Arista network for summer 2018, and I am very excited about that. If you want some help finding an internship or some skills in career fair, I may be able to help. As I stated above, I am a second-year senior, so I continuously take at least five courses each quarter. I can offer you some advice of how to manage your time properly and which courses to choose each quarter if you plan to graduate earlier. Outside academics, I really love computer games, for example, League of legends, NBA 2K sports, GTA, etc. I also do workouts regularly in recreation center. I hope I can not only be your tutor, but also your friend! Maybe we can play some computer games together or do some workouts together!" </i>

  <b>  Yuhao Zhang (Tutor) </b>
  <i> "Hello everyone! My name is Yuhao Zhang (he/him/his) and I am currently a third year Computer Science major. CS 8 is the very first CS class I took after I entered UCSB and I feel extremely excited for being a mentor for this class since I feel like I get my "first year feeling" back. Besides, I have a strong passion in teaching! This is my first time in tutoring to be honest. However, I am confident that I will communicate and teach well during the entire quarter. Moreover, in addition to the basic python skills in the course, I can also provide you some knowledge of specific python packages, such as torch. It is the time for a third year student to decide which specific branch to go further into and for now, my preferences are distributed, operating system and artificial intelligence. I have taken a machine learning class in Stanford last summer and I am now in the Vision and NLP lab directed by professor William Wang. Please feel free to ask me any questions in these fields and I will try my best to get you in. In addition to academy, I can also offer you information about the CS department and the College of Engineering. I transferred from Computer Engineering to Computer Science at the beginning of my second year so if you have any questions of switching major, I am the man for you! Outside of School, I love playing bowling, pool and ping-pang. I have been learning playing table tennis for over four years. In the meantime, however, I would like to learn to play tennis in the near future. You can also find me in the swimming pool in our gym. In addition, I love listening to popular European and classic Chinese music." </i>
